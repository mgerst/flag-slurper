Flag Slurper
============
Utility for grabbing CDC flags from machines.

Auto PWN
========
Flag slurper contains a utility for automatically attempting default credentials against team's SSH hosts. This works by
grabbing the team list from IScorE and a list of all the services. The default credentials it uses are:

- `root:cdc`
- `cdc:cdc`

Requirements
------------
AutoPWN requires a database. For many cases sqlite will do, but in order to use parallel AutoPWN a server-based database
(such as postgres) is required. This is due to sqlite only allowing one writer at a time. The database can be configured
in your flagrc file:

```ini
[database]
; For sqlite (default)
url=sqlite:///{{ project }}/db.sqlite

; For postgres
url=postgres:///slurper
```

The ``{{ project }}`` variable is the file path to the current project and is optional.

Usage
-----
You first need to create a project and result database:

```bash
flag-slurper project init -b ~/cdcs/isu2-18 --name "ISU2 2018"
flag-slurper project create-db
```

To generate the team and service list you can simply run:

```bash
flag-slurper autopwn generate
```

This will cache the team an service lists into the database. This will be used by other ``autopwn`` commands so they
don't need to keep hitting the IScorE API during the attack phase when the API is getting hammered.

After generating the local files, you can then pwn all the things!

```bash
flag-slurper autopwn pwn
```

This will print out what credentials worked on which machines and any flags found. These results are recorded in the
database and can be viewed like this:

```bash
flag-slurper autopwn results
```

Projects
========
Flag slurper has the concept of "projects". These projects tell flag slurper where to find various files such as the
``teams.yml`` and ``services.yml`` files. It may also contain other configuration options such as where flags are
located. The primary purpose of the project system is to keep data from different CDCs separate.

To create a project run:

```bash
flag-slurper project init --base ~/cdcs/isu2-18 --name "ISU2 2018"
```

This will create a project named "ISU2 2018" in the folder `~/cdcs/isu2-18`. You can then run the following command to
activate the project.

```bash
eval $(flag-slurper project env ~/cdcs/isu2-18)
```

When you want to deactivate a project, run the `unslurp` command.

Alternatively, you can specify `--project PATH` on each command. For example:

```bash
flag-slurper --project ~/cdcs/isu2-18/ autopwn generate
```

The above command will generate the local cache data and store it in the project.

Flags
-----
The Auto PWN feature will automatically look in common directories for flags that look like a flag. You can also specify
locations to check. The following project file defines the "Web /root flag"

```yaml
_version: "1.0"
project: ISU2 2018
base: ~/cdcs/isu2-18
flags:
  - service: WWW SSH
    type: blue
    location: /root
    name: team{{ num }}_www_root.flag
    search: yes
```

You can specify as many flags as you want. All of the following fields are required:

- **service**: The name of the service this flag is associated with. Auto PWN matches against this when determining what
  flags it should look for when attacking a service.
- **type**: Which flag type this is `blue` (read) or `red` (write). Currently only `blue` is supported.
- **location**: The directory the flag is supposed to be located in.
- **name**: The expected file name of the flag. Pay close attention to `{{ num }}`. This is a placeholder that will be
  replaced with the team number during the attack.
- **search**: Whether Auto PWN should search `location` for any files that are roughly the correct file size. A search
  is only performed if the flag is not found at it's exact name `{{ location }}/{{ name }}`.
 
Here's an example of an Auto PWN run that obtained flags:

Credentials
-----------
Credentials can be managed through the ``creds`` subcommand. To add a credential:

```bash
flag-slurper creds add root cdc
```

List credentials:

```bash
flag-slurper creds ls
```

Remove credential:

```bash
flag-slurper creds rm root cdc
```

Show details for a credential:

```bash
flag-slurper creds show root:cdc
```
